/**
 * The next(message) method in the context of this.notificationSubject.next(message) is used to emit a new value to all subscribers of the Subject. In RxJS, a Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers. The next() method is used to push values into the Subject.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

Subject in RxJS:

A Subject is both an Observable and an Observer.
This means you can subscribe to a Subject to receive values, and you can also emit values into a Subject.
next() Method:

The next() method is part of the Observer interface in RxJS.
When you call next(value), it emits the value to all subscribers of the Subject.
Emitting Values:

Calling this.notificationSubject.next(message) will pass the message to all components or services that have subscribed to notificationSubject
